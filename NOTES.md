# Notes

TODO: categorize and split


## ROS visualization

* [Webviz](https://webviz.io/)
	* Visualizing robotics data in the browser
	* https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz
	* a project of [Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com/)
	* currently, no ROS 2 support,
	  see [cruise-automation/webviz#348](https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz/issues/348)
* [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/)
	* [Foxglove Studio - visualization and debugging for ROS (ROS Discourse)](https://discourse.ros.org/t/foxglove-studio-visualization-and-debugging-for-ros/19627/14)
	* https://foxglove.dev/
	* https://github.com/foxglove/studio
	* a fork of Webviz
	* desktop app (in the future it should support direct connection to ROS nodes)
	* currently, no ROS 2 support, but planned


## ROS and macOS

* [Installing (binary) ROS 2 Foxy on macOS](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/macOS-Install-Binary.html)
	* `brew install asio tinyxml2 tinyxml eigen poco opencv console_bridge log4cxx spdlog sip pyqt5`
* [Is anyone using ROS2 GUI tools like rviz on macOS? (ROS Discourse)](https://discourse.ros.org/t/is-anyone-using-ros2-gui-tools-like-rviz-on-macos/16353/4)
* [ROS2 on MacOSX Catalina](http://www.robotandchisel.com/2020/08/10/rviz2-on-mac/)
* It is needed to use source `/opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash` when using `install/setup.bash` in the already successfully
  built ROS 2 colcon workspace?
	* It seems that it is NOT needed. It is only logical (it's the difference between `local_setup.bash`
	  and `setup.bash`).
* macOS <= 10.14.6 (Mojave)
